# Wyg Editor

A new WYSIWYG editing experience for the modern web.
First public beta (still many bugs to fix). Docs are pending.

- Built entirely from scratch
- Works better than anything before
- Minimalistic UI, blazingly fast (works with DOM nodes directly)
- Normalizes entered markup on the fly (splits paragraphs with linebreaks)
- Smart linebreak management (no Shift-Enter required to put a newline)
- Drag & drop media between paragraphs
- Arranges media nicely in columns
- Fluid layout with animations
- Pasted links get converted to media blocks instantly
- Floating markup panel with custom tags support
- Custom undo/redo manager (works with arbitrary DOM changes)
- Intercepts native undo/redo commands (not limited to hotkeys)
